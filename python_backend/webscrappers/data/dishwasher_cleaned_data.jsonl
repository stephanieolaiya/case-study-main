In many cases, our customers have reported the top rack of their dishwasher hanging down or sagging due to the adjuster kit, particularly if the wheels, have broken or failed. If you are having problems in this area, this kit will help get your dishwasher back up and running. Check your model number and user manual to see if this part is right for you. The parts for this kit come as a package and are not generally sold individually.", "Installation instructions": "Trial and error.

You will not require any tools to complete the job. This is an authentic part approved by the manufacturer.", "Installation instructions": "I carefully followed the video instructions step by step.

Anyway all you need to do is disconect the power from the dishwasher (unless you like to live dangerously like me) take your drill with the correct size torx bit and remove all the screws on the inside door pannel (the top center two screws actually hold the latch assembly in place). Disconect the 4 wires from the old part and reconect them to the new part and reinstall all the torx screws being careful not to strip the plastic threads that they screw into if you are using a drill.

The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results. This part is commonly associated with the E15 error code on dishwashers.", "Installation instructions": "The E:15 error code means water is detected in the pan under the unit. There are several ways this can happen.In this case, it was caused by a bad inlet valve. It did not close properly and led to an overflow of water inside that eventually spilled into the pan underneath the unit.I see now why the pump keeps running after this error. In this case, it would have led to a big flood in the kitchen if it did not.I was actually able to run the unit while broke by manually operating the valve under our sink that provides water to the unit.Be sure to turn off breaker before servicing. Don't get shocked!Be sure to turn off water before starting! Or, you'll have a flood.Anyway, I just pulled the unit out (was secured by 2 screws on the sides). I lifted up the insulation material on the left side to get at the valve. Pushed a little green tab to release the electrical plug. Then, use pliers to move clamp off the white water hose on the inside. Then, pull of white hose. This was hard in my case. Took a lot of force. Then, reach behind the unit and use pliers to unscrew water hose. Now, the whole gray panel there can pop out with some force. Then, slip the old valve out and slip new one in. Reconnect hoses and clamp. Note that I put some caulk on the connector where white hose goes.

Works like a champ. The one thing I did do at the same time is notice that there's only one return spring for the door handle (even though both the handle and latch bracket have hooks for springs on both sides. I suspect this is what caused the door handle to break in the first place (the spring causes uneven tension on the handle, which over time caused the arms on the handle to catch and break). So I also ordered a second spring, and when I attached the new door handle to the latch bracket assembly I also installed return springs on both sides.

Turn off the power to the unit at you breaker panel. The air inlet strip is fastened to the backside of the inner stainleess steel door panel. To access the screws the outer door panel must be removed. Open the door and remove the six torx head screws that fasten the outer door panel to the stainless steel inner door. Don't remove the two torx screws top dead center as they hold the door latch. After removing the screws, raise the door up to the nearly closed position. Lift up the outer door panel handle and door bottom to disengage the outer panel from the inner stainless door. The next part is a little tricky since the vent strip hex head screws are at he bottom of the stainless door panel, facing out with the door closed. The lip of the bottom stainless pan is high enough to make it a tight fit to access the screws. There is also a steel bracket that is a door stiffener and holds electrical wiring. I found removing the bracket held by a 1/4\" hex head screw on each side made access to the vent strip scews easier. Lay flat on the floor. With a 3/16\" nutdriver or socket wrench each of the five vent strip screws can be removed. It's a tight fit between the bottom lip and door bottom, but it can be done. Remove the old vent strip and attach the new one. Make sure it fits snugly into the slot. Best to have an extra pair of hands at this point to hold the stip securely in place while screws are reinserted from the opposite side. Reassemble everything in reverse order.It was when I had the outer door panel off that I noticed my problem was water getting past the upper round louver vent seal and thus running down the inside of the outer panel. Simple fix was to remove and clean the scale residue from the parts and door. Then reassemble the vent and twitst tighten the vent to compress the rubber seal on the inside face of the door.", "price": "$47.43"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Vent", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS11755274", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WPW10469574", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$75.47"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Diffuser", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS11755348", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WPW10476221", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$26.26"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Duct Assembly (Middle)", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS12085702", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number DD82-01428A", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$45.21"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Vent", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS11754644", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WPW10428211", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$106.09"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Vent", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS11752990", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WPW10329609", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$68.21"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher VENT - Gray/ HYBRID", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS8756249", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WD12X10471", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$17.33"}, {"part name": "Dishwasher Door Vent - White", "PartSelect Number": "PartSelect Number PS259045", "Manufacturer Part Number": "Manufacturer Part Number WD12X10026", "description": "", "Installation instructions": "N/A", "price": "$17.03"}]}

I decided if I was going to order parts and dig into a repair I should replace both. For the timer it is just a matter of unscrewing the inner door panel and unplugging the old timer. Then inserting new one. Couple of things I ran into were the door is no longer heavy enough to stay down so I grabbed a waffle iron as a weight to hold it down. Also will need to unscrew the set screw on the Door lock latch's bottom side. Pay close attention to how it was together helps.
