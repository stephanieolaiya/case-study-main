We will walk you through common refrigerator issues, as well as the parts that might be the fix you need.\nNoisy Refrigerator \u2013 It can be alarming if you hear loud noises coming from your fridge. It is not uncommon to notice buzzing, humming, clicking, and knocking noises. Figuring out the cause might be as simple as locating what section of your refrigerator it is coming from. Most often these sounds are caused by the parts that are in motion, like the condenser fan motor, and evaporator fan motor. If you notice a scraping sound it is often cause by one of the internal fans making contact with something as it spins. If it is rattling you notice be sure to check the fridge is level, and make sure drain pan is secured properly. A mild humming noise is normal, but if you notice an increased humming sound, the compressor might be overworked.\nLeaking Refrigerator \u2013 If you notice water leaking from your fridge, or inside, there is no need to panic, most often these leaks are simple to fix. Troubleshooting a leaking refrigerator starts with identifying where you find the water pooling. To solve this problem, you are going to want to first inspect your door gaskets and seals, inlet valves, water lines, and ice maker. These are the most common culprits when it comes to refrigerator leaks.\nRefrigerator Will Not Run \u2013 When the compressor in your refrigerator will not run the appliance will not be able to cool. It could be as simple as an issue with your start capacitor, overload, temperature control, or control board. These are the parts that monitor internal temperature and communicate with the compressor. If you have ruled those parts out the issue may be with the compressor itself.\nIce Maker Not Making Ice \u2013 If your ice maker is not making ice, it can often mean it is not getting the water it needs. It could be an issue with the water line, water inlet valve, or a water filter. Inspecting these parts will let you know if there is water flowing to the ice maker, and allow you to spot any issues with the water supply. Before looking at the water supply, we recommend you start by looking at the ice maker to make sure the bail arm is not stuck. If it is, your ice maker will stop making ice because it thinks the bin is full. Checking these parts and others is simple process. Your ice maker will be up and running in no time.\nRefrigerator Too Warm \u2013 When your fridge is not getting cold enough it is often a simple fix, it does not always signal control board issues. If your fridge is appropriately stocked, we suggest you start by checking the air circulation in the appliance.  The first step is making sure the air damper or baffle is undamaged, and unblocked; that is how cool air gets into your fridge. If that is fine you will need to then inspect the evaporator fan, condenser fan, and the temperature senor. It is also important to ensure you are routinely cleaning the condenser coils to help prevent issues like this.\n"}

The instructions from Whirlpool included with the part had minuscule pictures so it was hard to follow.  The written instructions were good.  But \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\"  Eventually it worked.  The metal replacement part is much better the the plastic original.  Not a good reflection on Whirlpool.\nRead more...\n\n\n", "\n\nDishwasher Rack Track Stop\n\n\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n 107 Reviews\n\n\nPartSelect Number PS11746591\nManufacturer Part Number WP8565925\r\n                    The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job.

Shoddy design and materials.\nI carefully followed the video instructions step by step.  They were detailed, clear, and pointed out how to avoid installation mistakes. WIthout the video I would have been tempted to just figure it out myself - (\"Hey, I'm a handy guy. How hard could it be, right?\"). With the video I sailed right through with no dumb errors. The new rack adjuster wheel set is much sturdier than the Whirlpool original. It made sense to get new rack stops at the same time.

The installation has been rated as \"easy\" by customers. Before beginning any repair, you should unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands.

The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately).

You might hear a knocking or banging sound coming from the dishwasher. The spray arm may not rotate properly or might seem wobbly. It is important to replace a damaged arm assembly as your dishes will not get cleaned properly, and they will still have dirt on them even after a wash cycle. It can also cause the dishwasher to have a bad smell because of leftover food residue. To remove your existing arm assembly, you will need to release its locking mechanism before lifting it out of your appliance.

Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in.
