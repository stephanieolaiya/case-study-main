Aged parts broken
After sitting in a cold refrigerator for year after year, plastic becomes brittle and breaks. This is what started happening to my shelves and door bins. The problem a lot of times is getting the right part since some of the parts do not have numbers. This website gives a accurate description and best of all photos on an inch grid, so I can measure what I have and find what I need. This time everything was perfect and fit easily. took no time and just like that I have almost double the space again. Funny how that works. Once before I didn't get the right piece so just pay attention to the dimensions.
